# UK Road Safety Analytics & Data Visualization

## Project Overview
A comprehensive analysis of UK road safety data from 2019-2022, examining traffic accidents and vehicle data to enhance road safety strategies. This project analyzes 660,680 accident instances across the UK, providing insights into accident patterns, casualty factors, and geographic distributions.

## Purpose
This analysis aims to:
- Identify patterns in traffic accidents across different regions of the UK
- Analyze the impact of various factors (weather, road conditions, vehicle types) on accident rates
- Provide data-driven recommendations for improving road safety measures
- Support policy-making and public awareness initiatives

## Dataset
The analysis utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing:
- 660,680 accident records
- 14 key variables including:
  - Accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
  - Geographic locations (420 unique districts)
  - Weather conditions
  - Road surface conditions
  - Vehicle types
  - Casualty information
  - Temporal data

## Key Findings
1. **Vehicle Type Analysis**
   - Cars involved in highest number of accidents (114,606 incidents)
   - Motorcycles and Goods Vans follow with significant numbers

2. **Geographic Distribution**
   - Birmingham leads with 13,491 accidents
   - Leeds (8,898) and Manchester follow as high-risk areas
   - Clear urban concentration of accidents

3. **Weather Impact**
   - 80.71% of accidents occur in fine weather
   - 11.73% during rain
   - 2.88% in snow or fog conditions

4. **Road Conditions**
   - 67.43% of accidents on dry roads
   - 25.72% on wet surfaces
   - 6.75% during frost & snow conditions

## Visualizations
The project includes several detailed visualizations:
- Vehicle type distribution charts
- District-wise accident frequency analysis
- Weather condition impact assessment
- Road surface condition analysis
- Geographic heat maps of accident locations
- Comprehensive dashboard with real-time filtering capabilities

## Technologies Used
- Tableau for data visualization and dashboard creation
- Data cleaning and preparation tools
- Geographic mapping tools for spatial analysis

## Recommendations
1. Focus educational campaigns on safe driving during seemingly safe conditions
2. Implement targeted urban infrastructure improvements
3. Develop weather-specific safety measures in high-risk areas
4. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of safety measures
